## Information


To enable the simulation of Mix-Used Districts a variety of data needs to be gathered, from archetypes for different building types, to assumptions about usage, e.g.. 

## Data Structure


The data folder contains essential information for simulating mixed-use districts. Here's an overview of the key components:

1. building_types.csv:
   This file serves as a central mapping for various building type classifications. It includes:
   - districtgenerator: Internal classification used by the tool
   - IWU: Classification according to the Institut Wohnen und Umwelt for non-residential buildings
   - SIA: Swiss standard classification 
   - CEA: City Energy Analyst classification
   - TEK: German energy efficiency standard classification
   - 18599_lightning: Classification for multi-zone average usage profiles
   - 18599 classification of archetypes 


2. occupancy_schedules:
   Contains CSV files with occupancy schedules for different building types, based on the SIA classification.
   Data obtained from City Energy Analyst: https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/CityEnergyAnalyst 

3. TEKs:
   Includes TEK_districtgenerator.csv, which provides energy consumption benchmarks for different building types.
   Data obtained from DIBS: https://github.com/IWUGERMANY/DibsData/blob/main/src/dibs_data/data/auxiliary/TEKs/TEK_NWG_Vergleichswerte_zuweisung.csv 

4. multi_zone_average:
   Contains Non-domestic-multi-zone-average-usage-profiles-for-Germany.csv, providing average usage profiles for non-residential buildings.
   Data obtained from IWU:  https://github.com/IWUGERMANY/Non-domestic-multi-zone-average-usage-profiles-for-Germany 

5. weather:
   Stores weather data files (e.g., EPW files) used for simulations.

6. scenarios:
   Contains CSV files describing different district scenarios, used as input for simulations.
   Data is generated by TECDEM:  https://github.com/TUB-DVG/TECDEM  


7. design_building_data.json:
   Contains design data for residential buildings.

8. non_residential_design_building_data.json:
   Contains design data for non-residential buildings.
   Data is obtained from: https://github.com/IWUGERMANY/Non-domestic-multi-zone-average-usage-profiles-for-Germany for heating and cooling limits. 


This structure allows for flexible and comprehensive modeling of various building types and their characteristics, enabling accurate simulation of mixed-use districts.
